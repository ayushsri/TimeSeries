# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## Key Concepts in Forecasting with Neural Networks

### Time Series Data
Time series data is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. For forecasting, we need data that represents some historical trend, such as:
- Daily stock prices
- Monthly sales figures
- Hourly temperature readings

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are ideal for time series prediction because they can remember past data points and recognize patterns over time.

## Steps to Build a Time Series Forecasting Model with LSTM

### 1. Prepare the Data
- Load the time series dataset.
- Normalize the data for better performance.
- Convert the data into sequences suitable for LSTM.

### 2. Build the Model
- Use LSTM layers to learn sequential patterns.
- Add Dense layers for final output predictions.
- Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

### 3. Train the Model
- Fit the model to training data.
- Use validation data to monitor performance.
- Tune hyperparameters if necessary.

### 4. Make Predictions
- Use the trained model to forecast future values.
- Compare predicted values with actual data.
- Visualize results using plots.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the script to train and test the LSTM model:
```bash
python forecast_model.py
```

## Results
- The trained model will predict future values based on historical data.
- Graphs will be generated to visualize model performance.
